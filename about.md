My name is **Govind S Nair**. I'm a student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, where I'm currently working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Applications with a specialisation in Data Science. Besides data science, I am also interested in cybersecurity, IoT, and cloud computing. I also do technical writing and contribute to open-source projects when time allows. 

When I’m not working or studying, you’ll likely find me winding down with a good book, watching movies, or experimenting with pixel art (my latest hobby).
